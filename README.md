**Find out who doesn’t follow you back on Instagram. Easily, privately, and without third-party apps.**

Tired of sketchy websites asking for your login credentials just to check your followers? **unFollowIG** offers a clean, safe, and open-source alternative.

 🧠 **How it works**

1. **Download your Instagram data**  
   You’ll learn how to request your follower and following lists directly from Instagram, sent to your own email inbox.

2. **Compare and discover**  
   This website compares those lists and shows who doesn’t follow you back, with direct links so you can manually unfollow them.
